					Angular11
					---------


	- Angular is Framework.

	- Angular Given by google.

	- Angular categorized into 3 flavours.

		1) AngularJS

	- TypeScript is the Programming Language given by Microsoft and follows the OOPS.

	- Angular Material, used to apply the Rich UI to both web applications and mobile applications.

	- Angular11 installation depending on npm tool.	

	- npm stands for node packaging manager.

	- npm present in NodeJS.
	
	- yarn is the 3rd party tool, provided by facebook used to download the 3rd party libraries.

	- Visual Studio Code is the Suggestable IDE to build the Angular11 Applications.

	- VSCode Given by Microsoft and open source IDE.


Installation of Angular11
-------------------------
1) install NodeJS

	NodeJS containes following tools.

		1) npm

		2) node

		3) npx

	npm stands for node pckaging manager

	npm helps to install Angular,React,VueJS,CoffeeScript,.......

	node tool, helps to execute the JavaScript.

	npx stands for node packaging runner.

	npx helps to create the react projects

file    : node-v16.1.0-x64.msi


	msi stands for microsoft installer



2) install yarn tool

	yarn is the tool, provided by facebook

	yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries

	we will install yarn tool by using following command


	> npm install -g yarn

	"-g" stands for global installation


3) install Angular11

	Angular11 also command based installation.

	
	> npm install -g @angular/cli


	cli stands for command line interface

	cli helps to create the angular applications in faster manner


4) link the yarn tool to cli tool


	> ng config -g cli.packageManager yarn

	where "M" is the capital in "packageManager"


5) install Visual Studio Code


	website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

	file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.56.0.exe



Steps to create the First Angular Application
---------------------------------------------
1) create the directory

	Ex.
		MEAN@11AM    (open with the help of VSCode)



2) create the angular application

	> ng new firstApp

	where "firstApp" is the name of the angular application.


3) switch to angular application

	> cd firstApp


4) execute the angular application

	> ng s -o

	"s" stands for "serve"

	"-o" stands for "open" the default browser.

	The default port number of angular application is "4200"


								Component

	- simple typescript class behaves like component.

	- Each Reusable Portion of complex UI called as Component.

	- As a Angular developer, we can provide communication between one component to another component.

********************************************
firstApp
       src
	     app
		   first.component.ts
		   first.component.html

		   app.module.ts

		index.html
********************************************

	"first.component.ts" file acting as component.

	"first.component.html" file, used to display the component result.

	"app.module.ts" file is the registration file.

	"index.html" file is the main template.

	angular starts the execution from "index.html" file.
